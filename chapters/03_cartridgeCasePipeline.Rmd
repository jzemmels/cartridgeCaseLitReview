## Abstract {-}

Forensic examinations attempt to solve the binary classification problem of whether two pieces of evidence originated from the same source.
For example, a cartridge case found at a crime scene may be compared to a cartridge case fired from a suspect’s firearm. 
Forensic examiners traditionally rely on high-powered comparison microscopes, case facts, and their own experience to arrive at a source conclusion. 
Automatic comparison algorithms have grown in prevalence in a number of forensic
disciplines following the reports from National Research Council (2009) and PCAST
(2016). 
Many of these algorithms objectively measure the similarity between evidence, such as two fired cartridge cases, based on markings left on their surface, such as impressions left by a firearm’s breech face during the firing process. 
We introduce the Automatic Cartridge Evidence Scoring (ACES) algorithm to compare pairs of three-dimensional topographical surface scans of breech face impressions. 
The ACES algorithm pre-processes the scans, extracts numeric features, and returns a similarity score indicating whether two cartridge cases were fired from the same firearm. 
The numeric features are computed based on a cell-by-cell registration procedure, results from a density-based unsupervised clustering algorithm, and derived from visual diagnostic tools we developed to investigate the performance of cartridge case comparison algorithms. 
We use scans taken at the Roy J Carver High Resolution Microscopy Facility of cartridge cases collected by Baldwin et al. (2014) to train and test the ACES algorithm. 
The performance of ACES compares favorably to several other methods, such as random forests on smaller feature sets, logistic regressions, decision trees, and some variants of previous Congruent Matching Cells methods (Song 2013; Zhang et al. 2021). 
The ACES algorithm is implemented in a free, opensource interactive web application called cartridgeInvestigatR.

## Introduction

A \emph{cartridge case} is the part of firearm ammunition that houses the projectile and propulsive device.
When a firearm is discharged and the projectile travels down the barrel, the cartridge case moves in the opposite direction and slams against the back wall, the \emph{breech face}, of the firearm.
Markings on the breech face are "stamped" into the surface of the cartridge case leaving so-called \emph{breech face impressions}.

In a traditional examination, forensic examiners use these impressions analogous to a fingerprint to determine whether two cartridge cases were fired from the same firearm.
The top of \autoref{fig:examination-algorithm-comparison} illustrates this procedure \citep{xiaoHui_seminar,Zheng2014,Vorburger2015}.
First, two cartridge cases are collected - perhaps one is from a crime scene and the other is collected from a suspect's gun.
An examiner places the two cartridge cases beneath a "comparison microscope" that merges the views of two compound microscopes into a single split view, similar to the side-by-side cartridge case image in \autoref{fig:examination-algorithm-comparison}.
The examiner assesses the degree of similarity between the markings on the cartridge cases and chooses one of four conclusions  \citep{AFTE1992}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Identification:} cartridge cases were fired from the same firearm

\item \textbf{Elimination:} cartridge cases were not fired from the same firearm

\item \textbf{Inconclusive:} the evidence is insufficient to make an identification or elimination

\item \textbf{Unsuitable:} the evidence is unsuitable for examination
\end{enumerate}

```{r,out.width="\\textwidth",echo=FALSE,fig.pos="htbp",fig.cap='\\label{fig:examination-algorithm-comparison} Comparison of the traditional examination vs. the currently proposed method for comparing cartridge cases. Both start with two fired cartridge cases. In traditional examination, an examiner uses a microscope to assess the "agreement" of markings on the two cartridge case surfaces. They decide whether or not the cartridge cases were fired from the same firearm, or if there is inconclusive evidence to decide. In the ACES algorithm, we take a topographical scan of the cartridge case surfaces and manually identify the regions containing distinguishable markings (shown in red). We pass these scans to the ACES algorithm, which processes and compares the two scans. The final result is a numerical measure of similarity of the two cartridge cases.'}
