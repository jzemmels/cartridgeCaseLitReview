abstract={The analysis of data can be conceptualized as a process of sequential steps or actions applied to data in order to achieve a quantitative result. An important aspect of the process is how to ensure that it is reproducible. Reproducibility as it applies to Statistics research involves both statistical reproducibility and computational reproducibility. Achieving reproducibility is not trivial, particularly if the problem is complex or involves data from non-standard sources. Automated bullet evidence comparison as proposed by Hare et al. (2017) involves both a complex data analysis as well as a non-standard form of data. Here, it serves as a large-scale motivating example, to help us study the impact of decision-making on the statistical and computational reproducibility of a quantitative result. We first present a method for data pre-processing and assess its impact on bullet land engraved area (LEA) matching accuracy. This is followed by a large user variability study of the high-resolution bullet LEA scanning process and development of an extended Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility framework. Finally, we propose a framework for adaptive computational reproducibility in a changing landscape of R packages and present software tools to facilitate the study and management of computational reproducibility in R.},

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},
