## Abstract {-}

Forensic examinations determine whether two pieces of evidence originated from the same source.
For example, a cartridge case found at a crime scene may be compared to a fired cartridge case collected from a suspect's firearm.
Historically, forensic examiners rely on high-powered comparison microscopes, case facts, and their own experience to arrive at a source conclusion.
Recently, algorithms that provide an automatic and objective measure of similarity of the evidence have become more popular.
We introduce a cartridge case comparison algorithm that encompasseses preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity scoring.
We use a train/test split on a data set of 510 cartridge case scans to fit and validate a random forest model.
We demonstrate that this random forest model yields improved accuracy compared to predominant algorithms.
Finally, we use the random forest model to calculate score-based likelihood ratios that estimate the probative value of the evidence.
