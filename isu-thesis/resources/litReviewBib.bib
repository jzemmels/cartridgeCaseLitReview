abstract={The analysis of data can be conceptualized as a process of sequential steps or actions applied to data in order to achieve a quantitative result. An important aspect of the process is how to ensure that it is reproducible. Reproducibility as it applies to Statistics research involves both statistical reproducibility and computational reproducibility. Achieving reproducibility is not trivial, particularly if the problem is complex or involves data from non-standard sources. Automated bullet evidence comparison as proposed by Hare et al. (2017) involves both a complex data analysis as well as a non-standard form of data. Here, it serves as a large-scale motivating example, to help us study the impact of decision-making on the statistical and computational reproducibility of a quantitative result. We first present a method for data pre-processing and assess its impact on bullet land engraved area (LEA) matching accuracy. This is followed by a large user variability study of the high-resolution bullet LEA scanning process and development of an extended Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility framework. Finally, we propose a framework for adaptive computational reproducibility in a changing landscape of R packages and present software tools to facilitate the study and management of computational reproducibility in R.},

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

abstract = {Abstract In the context of forensic cases involving firearms, a major issue to address is the identification of the firearm used to discharge questioned elements of ammunition—bullets or cartridge cases—found during the scene investigation. When a questioned firearm is available, reference bullets and cartridge cases are produced through controlled test-fires. The marks left on both the questioned and reference elements of ammunition are analyzed before being compared. The processes used to manufacture the firearms tend to influence the type and frequency of some of these marks. Knowing how the questioned firearm was produced is a key element to identify the relevant marks for comparison purposes. Finding this information can be challenging, as it is not necessarily publicly available. After presenting the manufacturing processes used to produce the main parts of firearms in contact with the elements of ammunition, this review includes an updated list of processes used by specific manufacturers, relying not only on the literature. The results highlight the necessity to consider a wide range of sources when gathering information about the manufacturing processes. Apart from general and specialized forensic literature, the online content made available by the manufacturers themselves is also a valuable complementary source of information. Contacting the manufacturers or visiting their premises is sometimes necessary to understand the full extent of the processes and how they can influence the marks of forensic interest.

abstract = {Forensic firearm examiners compare the features in cartridge cases to provide a judgment addressing the question about their source: do they originate from one and the same or from two different firearms? In this article, the validity and reliability of these judgments is studied and compared to the outcomes of a computer-based method. The features we looked at were the striation patterns of the firing pin aperture shear marks of four hundred test shots from two hundred Glock pistols, which were compared by a computer-based method. Sixty of the resulting 79,800 comparisons were shown to 77 firearm examiners. They were asked to judge whether the cartridge cases had the same source or a different source, and to indicate the degree of support the evidence provided for those judgments. The results show that the true positive rates (sensitivity) and the true negative rates (specificity) of firearm examiners are quite high. The examiners seem to be slightly less proficient at identifying same-source comparisons correctly, while they outperform the used computer-based method at identifying different-source comparisons. The judged degrees of support by examiners who report likelihood ratios are not well-calibrated. The examiners are overconfident, giving judgments of evidential strength that are too high. The judgments of the examiners and the outcomes of the computer-based method are only moderately correlated. We suggest to implement performance feedback to reduce overconfidence, to improve the calibration of degree of support judgments, and to study the possibility of combining the judgments of examiners and the outcomes of computer-based methods to increase the overall validity.}

year = {1996},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},
