	abstract = {Based on three-dimensional (3D) topography measurements on correlation cells, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed the ‘NIST Ballistics Identiﬁcation System (NBIS)’ aimed at accurate ballistics identiﬁcations and fast ballistics evidence searches. The 3D topographies are divided into arrays of correlation cells to identify ‘valid correlation areas’ and eliminate ‘invalid correlation areas’ from the matching and identiﬁcation procedure. A ‘congruent matching cells’ (CMC)’ method using three types of identiﬁcation parameters of the paired correlation cells (cross correlation function maximum CCFmax, spatial registration position in x–y and registration angle θ ) is used for high accuracy ballistics identiﬁcations. ‘Synchronous processing’ is proposed for correlating multiple cell pairs at the same time to increase the correlation speed. The proposed NBIS can be used for correlations of both geometrical topographies and optical intensity images. All the correlation parameters and algorithms are in the public domain and subject to open tests. An error rate reporting procedure has been developed that can greatly add to the scientiﬁc support for the ﬁrearm and toolmark identiﬁcation specialty, and give conﬁdence to the trier of fact in court proceedings. The NBIS is engineered to employ transparent identiﬁcation parameters and criteria, statistical models and correlation algorithms. In this way, interoperability between different ballistics identiﬁcation systems can be more easily achieved. This interoperability will make the NBIS suitable for ballistics identiﬁcations and evidence searches with large national databases, such as the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network in the United States.},

This article extends the literature by studying journal data sharing policies by year (for both 2011 and 2012) for a referent set of 170 journals. We make a further contribution by evaluating code sharing policies, supplemental materials policies, and open access status for these 170 journals for each of 2011 and 2012. We build a predictive model of open data and code policy adoption as a function of impact factor and publisher and find higher impact journals more likely to have open data and code policies and scientific societies more likely to have open data and code policies than commercial publishers. We also find open data policies tend to lead open code policies, and we find no relationship between open data and code policies and either supplemental material policies or open access journal status. Of the journals in this study, 38\% had a data policy, 22\% had a code policy, and 66\% had a supplemental materials policy as of June 2012. This reflects a striking one year increase of 16\% in the number of data policies, a 30\% increase in code policies, and a 7\% increase in the number of supplemental materials policies. We introduce a new dataset to the community that categorizes data and code sharing, supplemental materials, and open access policies in 2011 and 2012 for these 170 journals.},

Open data and open-source software have enabled the rapid implementation of novel methods to manage and analyze the growing flood of data. However, it has become apparent that many scientific fields exhibit distressingly low rates of reproducibility. Although there are many dimensions to this issue, we believe that there is a lack of formalism used when describing end-to-end published results, from the data source to the analysis to the final published results. Even when authors do their best to make their research and data accessible, this lack of formalism reduces the clarity and efficiency of reporting, which contributes to issues of reproducibility. Data provenance aids both reproducibility through systematic and formal records of the relationships among data sources, processes, datasets, publications and researchers.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to discover genetic variants associated with diseases. To control false positives, all findings from GWAS need to be verified with additional evidences, even for associations discovered from a high power study. Replication study is a common verification method by using independent samples. An association is regarded as true positive with a high confidence when it can be identified in both primary study and replication study. Currently, there is no systematic study on the behavior of positives in the replication study when the positive results of primary study are considered as the prior information. In this paper, two probabilistic measures named Reproducibility Rate (RR) and False Irreproducibility Rate (FIR) are proposed to quantitatively describe the behavior of primary positive associations (i.e. positive associations identified in the primary study) in the replication study. RR is a conditional probability measuring how likely a primary positive association will also be positive in the replication study. This can be used to guide the design of replication study, and to check the consistency between the results of primary study and those of replication study. FIR, on the contrary, measures how likely a primary positive association may still be a true positive even when it is negative in the replication study. This can be used to generate a list of potentially true associations in the irreproducible findings for further scrutiny. The estimation methods of these two measures are given. Simulation results and real experiments show that our estimation methods have high accuracy and good prediction performance.},

	abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown.

In current practice, firearms examiners inspect cartridge cases for “sufficient agreement,” in which case they conclude that they come from the same gun, testifying in courts as such. A 2016 President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report questioned the scientific validity of such analysis (President’s Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, Washington, DC, Executive Office of the President). One recommendation was to convert firearms analysis to an objective method. We propose a fully automated, open-source method for comparing breechface marks on cartridge cases using 2D optical images. We improve on existing methodology by automating the selection of marks, and removing the effects of circular symmetry. We propose an empirical computation of a “random match probability” given a known database, which can be used to quantify the weight of evidence. We demonstrate an improvement in accuracy on images from controlled test fires.},

	abstract = {In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences published a report questioning the scientific validity of many forensic methods including firearm examination. Firearm examination is a forensic tool used to help the court determine whether two bullets were fired from the same gun barrel. During the firing process, rifling, manufacturing defects, and impurities in the barrel create striation marks on the bullet. Identifying these striation markings in an attempt to match two bullets is one of the primary goals of firearm examination. We propose an automated framework for the analysis of the 3D surface measurements of bullet land impressions which transcribes the individual characteristics into a set of features that quantify their similarities. This makes identification of matches easier and allows for a quantification of both matches and matchability of barrels. The automatic matching routine we propose manages to (a) correctly identify land impressions (the surface between two bullet groove impressions) with too much damage to be suitable for comparison, and (b) correctly identify all 10,384 land-to-land matches of the James Hamby study.},

	abstract = {The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing the NIST Ballistics Identification System (NBIS) based on three-dimensional (3D) topography measurements and correlations of the paired correlation cells within the correlated topographies[1] to establish ballistics identifications. The Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) method [2] uses three criteria to determine a pair of matching cells. These consist of a threshold for the cross correlation function maximum CCFmax, and a consistent pattern for registration angle θ and x-y registration position among matching pairs of cells. The number of congruent matching cell pairs C is determined by the three identification parameters associated with their thresholds [2]. Presently the proposed numerical identification criterion for identification is C ≥ 6. That is, two surfaces are identified as being fired by the same firearm if they contain at least six matching cell pairs [1, 2]. In order to test the CMC method and to verify the proposed numerical identification criterion, 40 cartridge cases fired from pistols with 10 consecutively manufactured slides are measured by a 3D confocal microscope and correlated by the CMC method. The breech face topographies are divided into cell arrays (7 × 7 or 6 × 6) for correlation. There are a total of 780 correlations comprising 63 known-matching (KM) and 717 known-non-matching (KNM). Initial tests support both the proposed CMC method and the numerical identification criterion C ≥ 6 for ballistics identifications. Test results show a significant separation between the KM and KNM distributions without any false positive or false negative identification. This represents the highest objective identification accuracy for the same set of cartridge cases that have been tested at NIST thus far. The identification accuracy can be further improved by optimization of the number of cells and the thresholds of the identification parameters, and registration algorithm.},

	abstract = {Ballistic images of a cartridge case or bullet carry distinct “ﬁngerprints” of the ﬁrearm, which is the foundation of widely used forensic examination in criminal investigations. In recent years, prior work has explored the effectiveness of correlation-based approaches in matching ballistic imagery. However, most of these studies focused on highly controlled situations and used relatively simple image processing techniques, without leveraging supervised learning schemes. Toward improving the matching accuracy, especially on operational data, we propose a learning-based approach to compute the similarity between two ballistic images with breech face impressions. Speciﬁcally, after a global alignment between the reference and probe images, we unroll them into the polar coordinate for robust feature extraction and global registration. A gentleBoost-based learning scheme selects an optimal set of local cells, each constituting a weak classiﬁer using the cross-correlation function. Experimental results and comparison with stateof-the-art methods on the NIST database and a new operational database, OFL, obtained from Michigan State Forensics Laboratory demonstrate the viability of our approach.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to- a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge. This detection scheme uses several elongated operators at each point, and the directional operator outputs are integrated with the gradient maximum detector.},

We propose a method for comparing two shoe outsole impressions that relies on robust features (speeded-up robust feature; SURF) on each impression and aligns them using a maximum clique (MC). After alignment, an algorithm we denote MC-COMP is used to extract additional features that are then combined into a univariate similarity score using a random forest (RF). We use a database of shoe outsole impressions that includes images from two models of athletic shoes that were purchased new and then worn by study participants for about 6 months. The shoes share class characteristics such as outsole pattern and size, and thus the comparison is challenging. We find that the RF implemented on SURF outperforms other methods recently proposed in the literature in terms of classification precision. In more realistic scenarios where crime scene impressions may be degraded and smudged, the algorithm we propose—denoted MC-COMP-SURF—shows the best classification performance by detecting unique features better than other methods. The algorithm can be implemented with the R-package shoeprintr.},

	abstract = {When resampling an image to a new set of coordinates (for example, when rotating an image), there is often a noticeable loss in image quality. To preserve image quality, the interpolating function used for the resampling should be an ideal low-pass filter. To determine which limited extent convolving functions would provide the best interpolation, five functions were compared: A) nearest neighbor, B) linear, C) cubic B-spline, D) high-resolution cubic spline with edge enhancement (a = -1), and E) high-resolution cubic spline (a = -0.5). The functions which extend over four picture elements (C, D, E) were shown to have a better frequency response than those which extend over one (A) or two (B) pixels. The nearest neighbor function shifted the image up to one-half a pixel. Linear and cubic B-spline interpolation tended to smooth the image. The best response was obtained with the high-resolution cubic spline functions. The location of the resampled points with respect to the initial coordinate system has a dramatic effect on the response of the sampled interpolating function-the data are exactly reproduced when the points are aligned, and the response has the most smoothing when the resampled points are equidistant from the original coordinate points. Thus, at the expense of some increase in computing time, image quality can be improved by resampled using the high-resolution cubic spline function as compared to the nearest neighbor, linear, or cubic B-spline functions.},

In this paper, a valid data based NCC (VDNCC) algorithm is proposed for eliminating the effect of the void area. The new algorithm prevents void areas from being included in the calculation by introducing the valid data templates. VDNCC obtains higher NCC values and probabilities of correct matching in the experiments.

Based on the concept of correlation cells, a Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) method is proposed for accurate ballistic identification and error rate estimation using three sets characteristic parameters of the paired correlation cells: cross correlation function maximum CCFmax, spatial registration positions in x-y and registration phase angle θ. The proposed CMC method can be used for correlation of both geometrical topographies and optical images. The “congruent matching” method can be potentially applied for all case scenarios of fired cartridge cases, fired bullets, and toolmarks. The CMC parameters and algorithms are in the public domain and subject to open tests. High-speed correlations are ensured by “synchronous processing” of multiple correlation cell pairs at the same time. Based on the CMC method, an error rate procedure is proposed for establishing a statistical foundation to support nationwide ballistics identifications in forensic science, and to provide an error rate report for court proceedings in a manner similar to the method used for reporting the Coincidental (Random) Match Probability (CMP) in forensic identification of DNA evidences.},

	abstract = {The Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) method was invented at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for accurate ﬁrearm evidence identiﬁcation and error rate estimation. The CMC method is based on the principle of discretization. The toolmark image of the reference sample is divided into correlation cells. Each cell is registered to the cell-sized area of the compared image that has maximum surface topography similarity. For each resulting cell pair, one parameter quantiﬁes the similarity of the cell surface topography and three parameters quantify the pattern congruency of the registration position and orientation. An identiﬁcation (declared match) requires a signiﬁcant number of CMCs, that is, cell pairs that meet both similarity and pattern congruency requirements. The use of cell correlations reduces the effects of “invalid regions” in the compared image pairs and increases the correlation accuracy. The identiﬁcation accuracy of the CMC method can be further improved by considering a feature named “convergence,” that is, the tendency of the x–y registration positions of the correlated cell pairs to converge at the correct registration angle when comparing same-source samples at different relative orientations. In this paper, the difference of the convergence feature between known matching (KM) and known non-matching (KNM) image pairs is characterized, based on which an improved algorithm is developed for breech face image correlations using the CMC method. Its advantage is demonstrated by comparison with three existing CMC algorithms using four datasets. The datasets address three different brands of consecutively manufactured pistol slides, with signiﬁcant differences in the distribution overlap of cell pair topography similarity for KM and KNM image pairs. For the same CMC threshold values, the convergence algorithm demonstrates noticeably improved results by reducing the number of false-positive or false-negative CMCs in a comparison.},

	abstract = {Comparison of ﬁring pin impressions of cartridge cases is an important part of ﬁrearms evidence identiﬁcation. However, compared with breach face impressions, there is only a limited surface area over which ﬁring pin impressions can be compared. Furthermore, the curvature of ﬁring pin impressions makes it difﬁcult to perform automatic correlations of the surfaces. In this study, a new method and related algorithm named congruent matching cross-sections (CMX) are proposed. Each ﬁring pin impression is sliced into layers and the resulting circular cross-sections are converted to two dimensional linear proﬁles by a polar coordinate transformation. The differential proﬁle extraction method is used for extracting the high frequency micro-features, or the individual characteristics, for accurate correlation. Three parameters are proposed for determining whether these pairwise ﬁring pin impressions are ﬁred from the same ﬁrearm. The cross-correlation function (CCF) is used for quantifying similarity of the pairwise proﬁles which represent the two correlated ﬁring pin images. If the correlated cartridge pair is ﬁred from the same ﬁrearm, the maximum CCF value between each of the proﬁle pairs from the reference and the correlated ﬁring pin impressions will be high. The other two parameters relate to the horizontal (or angular) and vertical range of relative shifts that the proﬁles undergo to obtain the maximum CCF. These shifts are the phase angle u which corresponds to a horizontal shift of the 2D proﬁles and the vertical shift distance of slice section, i.e. where the proﬁles match in the depth of the impression. These shift parameters are used to determine the congruency of the pairwise proﬁle patterns. When these parameter values and their statistical distributions are collected for analysis, the CMX number is derived as a key parameter for a conclusive identiﬁcation or exclusion. Validation tests using 40 cartridge cases of three different brands ﬁred from 10 ﬁrearms produced by three different manufacturers yielded clear separation between known matching (KM) and known non-matching (KNM) image pairs, which strongly supports the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed CMX method.},

	abstract = {The task of identifying ﬁrearms from forensic ballistics specimens is exacting in crime investigation since the last two decades. Every ﬁrearm, regardless of its size, make and model, has its own unique ‘ﬁngerprint’. These ﬁngerprints transfer when a ﬁrearm is ﬁred to the ﬁred bullet and cartridge case. The components that are involved in producing these unique characteristics are the ﬁring chamber, breech face, ﬁring pin, ejector, extractor and the riﬂing of the barrel. These unique characteristics are the critical features in identifying ﬁrearms. It allows investigators to decide on which particular ﬁrearm that has ﬁred the bullet. Traditionally the comparison of ballistic evidence has been a tedious and timeconsuming process requiring highly skilled examiners. Therefore, the main objective of this study is the extraction and identiﬁcation of suitable features from ﬁring pin impression of cartridge case images for ﬁrearm recognition. Some previous studies have shown that ﬁring pin impression of cartridge case is one of the most important characteristics used for identifying an individual ﬁrearm. In this study, data are gathered using 747 cartridge case images captured from ﬁve different pistols of type 9 mm Parabellum Vektor SP1, made in South Africa. All the images of the cartridge cases are then segmented into three regions, forming three different set of images, i.e. ﬁring pin impression image, centre of ﬁring pin impression image and ring of ﬁring pin impression image. Then geometric moments up to the sixth order were generated from each part of the images to form a set of numerical features. These 48 features were found to be signiﬁcantly different using the MANOVA test. This high dimension of features is then reduced into only 11 signiﬁcant features using correlation analysis. Classiﬁcation results using crossvalidation under discriminant analysis show that 96.7\% of the images were classiﬁed correctly. These results demonstrate the value of geometric moments technique for producing a set of numerical features, based on which the identiﬁcation of ﬁrearms are made.},

This article demonstrates the use of the Congruent Matching Cell (CMC) algorithm to compare 3D topography measurements of breech face impressions and ﬁring pin impressions from a previously distributed ﬁrearms proﬁciency test. In addition, the algorithm is used to analyze the distribution of many comparisons from a collection of cartridge cases used to construct another recent set of proﬁciency tests.

 abstract = {Some new diagnostic measures in discriminant analysis are proposed. They can be expressed in terms of the two fundamental influence statistics in discriminant analysis: d2 i and ψ̂i. A theorem on the asymptotic distributions of the fundamental statistics is derived. Based on the theorem, the proposed measures can be shown to be asymptotically distributed as functions of independent chi-squared and standard normal random variables. Critical values and expected quantiles of the measures can then be constructed. Hence influential observations are detected using Q-Q plots and significance tests. Two measures have analogous forms in regression. The theorem is also useful for getting the asymptotic distributions of existing measures that are functions of d2 i and ψ̂i. A comparison of the diagnostics in linear discriminant analysis, linear regression, and linear logistic regression (discriminant) analysis is made. Although discriminant coefficients can be determined under a regression model, regression diagnostic measures are shown to be inappropriate for detecting influential observations in linear discriminant analysis. The temptation of applying regression diagnostic measures in linear discriminant analysis must be resisted.},

Furthermore, the curvature of ﬁring pin impressions makes it difﬁcult to perform automatic correlations of the surfaces. In this study, a new method and related algorithm named congruent matching cross-sections (CMX) are proposed. Each ﬁring pin impression is sliced into layers and the resulting circular cross-sections are converted to two dimensional linear proﬁles by a polar coordinate transformation. The differential proﬁle extraction method is used for extracting the high frequency micro-features, or the individual characteristics, for accurate correlation. Three parameters are proposed for determining whether these pairwise ﬁring pin impressions are ﬁred from the same ﬁrearm. The cross-correlation function (CCF) is used for quantifying similarity of the pairwise proﬁles which represent the two correlated ﬁring pin images. If the correlated cartridge pair is ﬁred from the same ﬁrearm, the maximum CCF value between each of the proﬁle pairs from the reference and the correlated ﬁring pin impressions will be high. The other two parameters relate to the horizontal (or angular) and vertical range of relative shifts that the proﬁles undergo to obtain the maximum CCF. These shifts are the phase angle u which corresponds to a horizontal shift of the 2D proﬁles and the vertical shift distance of slice section, i.e. where the proﬁles match in the depth of the impression. These shift parameters are used to determine the congruency of the pairwise proﬁle patterns. When these parameter values and their statistical distributions are collected for analysis, the CMX number is derived as a key parameter for a conclusive identiﬁcation or exclusion. Validation tests using 40 cartridge cases of three different brands ﬁred from 10 ﬁrearms produced by three different manufacturers yielded clear separation between known matching (KM) and known non-matching (KNM) image pairs, which strongly supports the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed CMX method.},

	abstract = {In forensics, evidence such as DNA, ﬁngerprints, bullets and cartridge cases, shoeprints or digital evidence is often compared, to infer if they come from the same or diﬀerent sources. This helps to generate leads through database searches, where information from diﬀerent investigations can be combined, if pieces of evidence are judged to have come from the same source. For speciﬁc pairs of comparisons, such as whether a particular cartridge case comes from a suspect’s gun, an inference of a match can also be used as testimony in courts. We demonstrate how such matching problems ﬁt into the record linkage framework commonly used in statistics and computer science, and explore how the latter can inform the former. In particular, we consider two forensic matching problems. The ﬁrst is ﬁrearms identiﬁcation, where cartridge cases are compared to infer if they were ﬁred from the same gun. We have developed an open-source, fully automatic method to compare 2D optical images, and will extend this to 3D topographies. We propose computing “signatures” instead of using pixel-level information, so that database searches are feasible. Comparisons should produce some measure of the weight of evidence, such as a likelihood ratio, that can be reported in courts. Finally, we plan to compare our error rates to that of ﬁrearms examiners.},

It has been prepared with the support of the European Community's Directorate General XII and represents the culmination of research conducted by 11 international partners as part of an EU-funded project. The aim of the project is to inform standards bodies of the possibilities that exist for a new international standard covering the field of 3D surface characterisation. The book covers a description of the proposed 3D surface parameters and advanced filtering techniques using wavelet and robust Gaussian methodologies. The next generation areal surface characterisation theories are discussed and their practical implementation is illustrated. It describes techniques for calibration of 3D instrumentation, including stylus instruments as well as scanning probe instrumentation. Practical verification of the 3D parameters and the filtering is illustrated through a series of case studies which cover bio-implant surfaces, automotive cylinder liner and steel sheet. Finally, future developments of the subject are alluded to and implications for future standardisation and development are discussed.",

Based on the concept of correlation cells, a Congruent Matching Cells (CMC) method is proposed for accurate ballistic identification and error rate estimation using three sets characteristic parameters of the paired correlation cells: cross correlation function maximum CCFmax, spatial registration positions in x-y and registration phase angle θ. The proposed CMC method can be used for correlation of both geometrical topographies and optical images. The “congruent matching” method can be potentially applied for all case scenarios of fired cartridge cases, fired bullets, and toolmarks. The CMC parameters and algorithms are in the public domain and subject to open tests. High-speed correlations are ensured by “synchronous processing” of multiple correlation cell pairs at the same time. Based on the CMC method, an error rate procedure is proposed for establishing a statistical foundation to support nationwide ballistics identifications in forensic science, and to provide an error rate report for court proceedings in a manner similar to the method used for reporting the Coincidental (Random) Match Probability (CMP) in forensic identification of DNA evidences.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to- a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge. This detection scheme uses several elongated operators at each point, and the directional operator outputs are integrated with the gradient maximum detector.},

In recent years, prior work has explored the effectiveness of correlation-based approaches in matching ballistic imagery. However, most of these studies focused on highly controlled situations and used relatively simple image processing techniques, without leveraging supervised learning schemes. Toward improving the matching accuracy, especially on operational data, we propose a learning-based approach to compute the similarity between two ballistic images with breech face impressions. Speciﬁcally, after a global alignment between the reference and probe images, we unroll them into the polar coordinate for robust feature extraction and global registration. A gentleBoost-based learning scheme selects an optimal set of local cells, each constituting a weak classiﬁer using the cross-correlation function. Experimental results and comparison with stateof-the-art methods on the NIST database and a new operational database, OFL, obtained from Michigan State Forensics Laboratory demonstrate the viability of our approach.},

	abstract = {In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences published a report questioning the scientific validity of many forensic methods including firearm examination. Firearm examination is a forensic tool used to help the court determine whether two bullets were fired from the same gun barrel. During the firing process, rifling, manufacturing defects, and impurities in the barrel create striation marks on the bullet. Identifying these striation markings in an attempt to match two bullets is one of the primary goals of firearm examination. We propose an automated framework for the analysis of the 3D surface measurements of bullet land impressions which transcribes the individual characteristics into a set of features that quantify their similarities. This makes identification of matches easier and allows for a quantification of both matches and matchability of barrels. The automatic matching routine we propose manages to (a) correctly identify land impressions (the surface between two bullet groove impressions) with too much damage to be suitable for comparison, and (b) correctly identify all 10,384 land-to-land matches of the James Hamby study.},

	abstract = {The congruent matching cells (CMC) method was invented at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for firearm evidence identification and error rate estimation. The CMC method divides the correlated image pairs into cells and uses four parameters to quantify topography similarity and pattern congruency of the correlated cell pairs in firearm breech face impressions on fired cartridge cases. A preliminary conservative numerical identification criterion of C = 6 CMCs was suggested for identifying images of cartridge cases fired from the same firearm. The CMC method was validated by correlations using both three-dimensional (3D) topography images and two-dimensional (2D) optical images from a set of 40 cartridge cases fired from a firearm set composed of 10 consecutively manufactured pistol slides. However, in the original CMC method, due to the difference in the effective data area of the correlated cells, final CMCs obtained from an image pair presented different data quantity (or validity level), and thus the empirical criterion C = 6 CMCs did not remain optimal for identification when the correlated cell size changed. In this study, a normalized congruent matching area (NCMA) method that considers the difference in the data area in each correlated cell pair was developed. Based on the NCMA method, an optimal range of cell sizes for breech face identification with granular characteristics was determined. A binomial model was used to fit the known nonmatching NCMA probability distribution ΨNCMA, and a beta-binomial model was used to fit the known matching NCMA probability distribution ΦNCMA. An experimental improvement in the normalized identification criterion C of around 6 \% was observed in the validation tests when the cell sizes were in the optimal range.},

	abstract = {Estimating error rates for firearm evidence identification is a fundamental challenge in forensic science. This paper describes the recently developed congruent matching cells (CMC) method for image comparisons, its application to firearm evidence identification, and its usage and initial tests for error rate estimation. The CMC method divides compared topography images into correlation cells. Four identification parameters are defined for quantifying both the topography similarity of the correlated cell pairs and the pattern congruency of the registered cell locations. A declared match requires a significant number of CMCs, i.e., cell pairs that meet all similarity and congruency requirements. Initial testing on breech face impressions of a set of 40 cartridge cases fired with consecutively manufactured pistol slides showed wide separation between the distributions of CMC numbers observed for known matching and known non-matching image pairs. Another test on 95 cartridge cases from a different set of slides manufactured by the same process also yielded widely separated distributions. The test results were used to develop two statistical models for the probability mass function of CMC correlation scores. The models were applied to develop a framework for estimating cumulative false positive and false negative error rates and individual error rates of declared matches and non-matches for this population of breech face impressions. The prospect for applying the models to large populations and realistic case work is also discussed. The CMC method can provide a statistical foundation for estimating error rates in firearm evidence identifications, thus emulating methods used for forensic identification of DNA evidence.},

	abstract = {The Miami-Dade Police Department Crime Laboratory conducted a research study on the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions on fired cartridge casings fired in 10 consecutively manufactured 9mm Ruger slides to improve understanding of the accuracy, reliability, and measurement validity in the firearm and tool mark discipline of forensic science. The foundation of firearm and tool mark identification is that each firearm/tool produces a signature of identification (striation/impression) that is unique to that firearm/tool, and through the examination of the individual striations/impressions, the signature can be positively identified to the firearm/tool that produced it. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Report questioned the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions left on fired evidence as well as the validity and error rate in firearms identification. This study analyzed the repeatability and uniqueness of striations/impressions on fired cartridge cases fired in 10 consecutively manufactured Ruger slides by analyzing breech face striations/impressions through an evaluation of the participants’ accuracy in making correct identifications. One semi-automatic pistol and nine additional consecutively manufactured slides were utilized. Consecutively manufactured slides are significant to this study because they were manufactured with the same equipment/tools, one right after the other. Even though these slides were consecutively made, their signatures should be different. Test sets included test fired casings from each slide, as well as unknowns. Participants were firearm \& tool mark examiners throughout the United States. One hundred and fifty-eight test sets were distributed to laboratories in forty-six states and the District of Columbia. The test sets were designed to determine an examiner’s ability to correctly identify unknown cartridge casings fired from 10 consecutively manufactured Ruger Slides to test fired cartridge casings fired from the same slides. This empirical study established an error rate of less than 0.1 percent. Durability testing established that the Ruger Slides maintained their individual signature after multiple firings.},
