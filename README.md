## Important Papers

### CMC Papers

- *Proposed “NIST Ballistics Identification System (NBIS)” Based on 3D Topography Measurements on Correlation Cells* Song (2013)

  - [https://www.nist.gov/publications/proposed-nist-ballistics-identification-system-nbis-based-3d-topography-measurements](https://www.nist.gov/publications/proposed-nist-ballistics-identification-system-nbis-based-3d-topography-measurements)

  - Synopsis/Contribution: Introduces the concept of *correlation areas* and proposes using the comparison of *correlation cells* to estimate the registration phase (translation) and angle of two cartridge cases. The "Contiguous Matching Cells" Method is discussed to quantify the similarity between two cartridge cases.

  - Limitations: There are few details provided in this paper in how the method should actually be implemented, although discussion of an actual implementation was not the focus of this paper. The various thresholds discussed in the paper (e.g., section 4) is based without much justification on the Consecutive Matching Striae paper.
